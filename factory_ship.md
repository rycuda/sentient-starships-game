## Base Ship

**Pick your base ship size and stats from one of the predone models (and note it) i.e., courier, strike cruiser, etc**

_Bulk Freighter_

Bulk freighters usually carry cargo in bulk containers, and carry out regular runs between densely populated systems.

## Customise Ship

**Determine engines, shielding, armor, etc. Pick 2-4 special systems if desired**

### Engines
Particle Impulse Engine, 
Thrusters

### Armor
Neutronite (Hardness 40, 1/4 weight of ship) 

### Defense Systems  

(5 base, 1 extra from flaws)
- Sub-Surface Armored Plating, (Damage that ignored hardness is halved)
- Improved damage control (4d10), 
- point-defense system, 
- Medium fortification, (75% chance to negate criticals)
- Repair Drones (damage control as a free action)
- Improved Autopilot 
 
### Sensors
- Class VI sensor array, 
- Combined sensors 
  - Proximity Sensors
  - Targetting Sensors

### Communications 

- Mass transceiver
- Radio transceiver

### Weapons

5 total
- Mining Ripper(PJR301 pg4) (Costs 3 slots)
- Needle driver
- Grappling Systems: 
  - Tractor beam emitter

In place of three weapons, a starship maybe equipped with mining rippers – drills and scoops that eat through a planet or asteroid's surface and extract valuable materials. 
Mining rippers can extract two tons of material each round though the ship must be moving at only 1 square per round for the device to work – any faster and the mining rippers are torn off and are completely destroyed. 
The device instantly feeds the mined materials directly into a designated cargohold on the ship.

### Special

 - Harvester System
 - Fabricator System
 - Heavy Load Body

### Gear

Sass' comms contraption. +4 to bluff

### Flaws

**(if desired 2 max)**
  - Flies like a brick  [homebrew]
    - (-500' speed -2 to piloting in atmosphere)
  - Sheltered [source](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/sheltered/)
    - (Whenever you have less than half your maximum hit points, you are shaken.) 
  - Overprotective [source](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/overprotective/)
    - If one of your allies should fall unconscious from hit point damage, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks as long as you are farther than 1000 feet away from your fallen ally.

## Ship Description


**Have idea of your ship structure appearance and abilities.  Feel free to describe in 1-2 paragraphs!**

hexagonal prism central hull, with a large, boxy engine section. The main hull is bracketed by two hemi-cylindrical shaped, with flat hexagonal cutouts. Two of the cutouts are populated by drones.

The engine portion of the ship is almost entirely dedicated to the actual engines, the vessel's power demands are not modest between production facilities and the power required to actually move the ship and its heavy cargo. 

The main hull is divided into two portions: The upper section is dedicated to ship functions, and flight crew, also housing the ship's anti-asteroid defences. The lower section of the hull is modular. The harvester equipment built directly into the superstructure at the front, behind it is a central spine (housing bulk transport, and utility conduits) with production modules mounted along its length. 

The 'wings' house the support facility for the vessel's mining drones, both cargo handling, and refuel and maintenance services are on hand to keep the harvesters at maximum productivity.

Ingest raw materials, output finished product. Designed as a support to extend the range of operations of other ships. Able to produce repairs, and resupplies in the field

**Maybe a short personality archetype for moving forward.**

Grown AI, possibly by AIs?

Initially somewhere between "Hi! I'm talky toaster, can I interest you in some toast?" and "I am bender, please insert girder"

Basically a factory fresh AI, with the personality designed to form over time to better accomodate their crew.



**Attack:** -8 (size) +3 (targetting) + dex + gunner to hit bonus + range penalty
**Defence:** -8 (size) 

**Attack of Opportunity:** Point-defense system +3 ranged (3d12×10)
